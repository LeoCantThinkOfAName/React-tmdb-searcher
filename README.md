### This is a React Application made with context api and TMDB api.

---

## What's the purpose?

Errr...  
Try to use react context api to make a small scale application based on TMDB api...  
So, just a little practice :P

## How to use it?

This is a very basic application, that user can search the movie they want via TMDB api (which is already a very nice, and user friendly website, I highly recommended everybody to check it out :P).

## What's the functionality?

For now, I've implement the i18n(en and tw). So the user can toggle the language to actually change not only the interface language but also the data retrieved from TMDB.

And benefited from TMDB api, user can search the movie from real-world database and see the movie's poster, genres, overvie, casts et cetera...

## Todo list...

- ‚úÖMake a poster area.
- ‚úÖMake a info area.
- ‚úÖFetch data from TMDB api and put them into poster and info area using context api.
- ‚úÖImplement i18n functionality, which can change the interface's and data's language.
- ‚ùéMake a searchbox that have fuzzy match function, and display a list that user can choose from.

## Ideas...

- Using react router for a better user experience (that can share the url for others, or at least user can revisit the same page)
- Show the rating of the movie?
- Make actor Searchable? Maybe use the same layout to display actor's profile?

This was supposed to be a weekend project, due to my laziness and a stupid yet lovelyüòª christmas gift exchange reunion event, I have to split this into multi-day project...
